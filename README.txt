/*IMPLEMENTATION of AES Algorythm by Bj√∂rn Klein
The goal was to understand how AES works (I learned the working of AES Algorithm with the youtube videos from NESO Academy on AES https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MPkc-PFSRI&t=258s, where he explains the theorie about AES algorithm)
After understanding the theory of how it works, I  created my own AES Implementation without using anything else beside standard c libraries to be used on my Arduino/ESP32 Projects.
The project is a proof of concept and is not fine tuned / optimized now also structure is right now all in one file as it is easyer to use in ESP32. I will maybe create a library later

to compile : gcc AES -o AES
to run ./AES

When you run the binary you can enter a Phrase that is then AES256 encrypted , the cypjhertext is printed out, it is decrypted and the decrypted text is printed out
